# agent-5man
specific to my 5 man group using Vfx3

cleaner version of "agent2"     
trying to improve upon playability/reliability    
only testing and making changes for group: Tank slot1, Healer slot2, Dps slot 3,4,5  some code specific to Healer   
testing using Vfx3 only - any changes should work with other layouts, not checking other layouts at this point tho     
big improvement on the use of Atoms vs "agent2" - not perfect, but much more reliable than "agent2"
Performance and Highlighter not enabled yet - haven't had time to look and see why clients crash more often with them on

Party buttons stayed the same as agent2: Mouse1, Mouse2, MouseWheel
Vfx buttons same as agent2: Mouse2, MouseWheel
Toggle buttons same as well: Mouse1, MouseWheel     
Relaygroups same: party, ranged, tank, heal, dps, monk, priest, mage, warlock, warrior
