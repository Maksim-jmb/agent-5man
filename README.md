# agent-5man  

*currently only working on 1.02 Build 6772 - new changes with teams on 1.03 Build, currenlty adapting too     

specific to my 5 man group using Vfx3

cleaner version of "agent2"     
trying to improve upon playability/reliability    
only testing and making changes for group: Tank slot1, Healer slot2, Dps slot 3,4,5  some code specific to heal/party groups   
testing using Vfx3 only - any changes should work with other layouts, not checking other layouts at this point tho     
big improvement on the use of Atoms vs "agent2" - not perfect, but much more reliable than "agent2"     
Performance and Highlighter not enabled yet - haven't had time to look and see why clients crash more often with them on

Party buttons stayed the same as agent2: Mouse1, Mouse2, MouseWheel     
Vfx buttons same as agent2: Mouse2, MouseWheel     
Toggle buttons same as well: Mouse1, MouseWheel     
Relaygroups same: party, ranged, tank, heal, dps, monk, priest, mage, warlock, warrior

Progression from "agent2"     
My setup 2 monitors: 2560x1080, 1920x1080     
Razer Keypad - limited keys compared to keyboard, so i try use buttons/mouseclicks where i can     
currently running the group thru Hellfire instances trying to tweak things for smooth/reliable gameplay     

** mainly a gameplay issue on my end - getting use to not moving the mouse while swapping out of RR to Vfxview or focus heal    
* things get a little squirrelly when i do, usually dropping the healer client - main driver in my case

i'll post a video when i get things more into memory - not automatic yet, to used to isboxer setup - have to stop and think sometimes what keys/buttons to hit atm with JMB

1/17 changed a couple small things - post them tomorrow, pretty playable atm...been running some instances fairly smooth without breaking clients tonight.  Here is a quick video of vfx and little boss kill from Cata dungeons.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ0jAJd4i9I
